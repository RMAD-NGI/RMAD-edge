New in RMAD-EDGE software version SW_VERTION: 9

	bugfixes:
	
		- joindutucycle redused to 10% after 4 aux packets - approximatly 1 hour (previously 24 hours)
		- MOTE_CHECK_MIN_INTERVAL increased to 259200 - approximatly 72 hours (previously 24 hours)
		- set GPIO B12 to input when changing back to DAC ref. Cosmetic fix as testing showed that functionality was working in sw8
		
	modified functions:
	
		rmad.c
			-main()
			
		dust_com.c
			-dust_handle_notification()
	

New in RMAD-EDGE software version SW_VERTION: 8

	new features:
	
	-Support for more than two channels
	-OMSG_EVENT replaces OMSG_AVALANCHE and OMSG_AVALANCHE_JBV, calc_timstamp and reached_limit obmitted
	-OMSG_LOGGINGSTARTED obmitted
	-HW_COFIGURATION replaced by CONFIG_AD_NCHANS in rmad.h and aux_data
	-Aux_data packet updated with sdv and mean for all channels included in CONFIG_AD_NCHANS
	-Inital adjustable parameters sett according to CONFIG_AD_NCHANS
	
	new and changed functions:
	
		rmad.h
			-main()
			
		aux_data.c
			-send_aux_data()
			
		dust_com.h
		
		prosess.c
			-process_ringbuf_entries()
			
		adjustable_parameters.c
			-adjustable_params_init()
	
	bugfixes:
		-Reduced amount of debug output during trigg
	
	know issues:
		-Only tested properly for CONFIG_AD_NCHANS = 2 and 4
		-Very slow setteling of DAC offset for AD channels when using VDD/64 as ref for trigg. Do not revert when switching back to DAC ref, reboot needed for normal operation.
		-Setting of join dutycyle to 10% after 24 hours do not work together with efm32_reset() in dust_check_and_possibly_reset_mote(). When mote is lost, join dutycylce will always be 100%
		
		



New in RMAD-EDGE software version SW_VERTION: 7

	new features:

	-Added additional parameters to jbv_events in order to simplify coupling between realtime data and raw data.  
	-Calc_timestamp calculaded from the measured samplingrate from previous trigg (prev_sps).
	-Fixed bug where process_send_data() did not return for HW=6.
	-channels in OMSG_DATA caclulated from CONFIG_AD_NCHANS, channels in IMSG_SENDDATA ignored
	-JoinDutyCyle sett to 100% for the first 24 hours after EFM32 boot/reboot.
	-Prits hw, sw and mac on boot when debug=true.
	-Mote deep sleep only after two consecutive low battery < 3.5V
	
	new and changed functions:
	
		process.c / process.h (functions updatet to communicate with W29N01HV Nandflash)
			-process_hybrid_send_data()
			-process_W29N01HV_hybrid_ringbuf_entries()
			-process_ringbuf_entries()
			-send_data()
			
		nandflash_H29N01HV.c / nandflash_H29N01HV.h (updatet copy of nandflash.c with the same function set for W29N01HV Nandflash)
			-NANDFLASH_W29N01HV_Hybrid_ReadPage()
			
		config.c	
			-dust_mote_setup()
		
	know issues:
		- Communication between EFM32 and SmartmeshIP mote fails periodicaly, looks to be in combination with poor radiolink and heavy radio traffic - dust_mote_reset when reciveng alarm events added for testing
		- ScanStart og ScanStop in IMSG_SENDDATA are apears to be convertet to sign integer before processing. Cannot use values higher the 0x7FFFFFFF (0xFFFFFF7F with little endian from backend)
		- New flash in hw6 is only using 16MB of 128MB as the hybrid solution uses both page- and block- size equal to the old flash. Number of blocks in new flash is half of the old.


New in RMAD-EDGE software version SW_VERTION: 6

	new features:

	-RMAD-EDGE SW6 replaces RMAD-railway.  
	-Disable ACP0 and ACP1 interupts on boot and when mote is lost. Should hopefully fix infinite reboot cycles togeter with full system reset on fail to connect.
	-Updatet all relavant files with check on HW_REVITION number, to allow backwards compability for HW_REVITION 4 & 5. Older revitions are discontinued
	-New debug output from EFM32 on UART1 using retargeio.c  (baudrate:115200)
	-AUX data functions updatet making it possible to include AD channels before and after turning on preamp, as well as SDV and Mean values
	-Implementeted transport mode function, requiering hard reset to recover.
	-Implementet communication with Windwand W29N01HV Nandflash for HW revision 6
	-Removed possibility to retrive list of datasets in Nandflash (IMSG_LISTDATA)
	-Implemented option for fast charge og battery (IMSG_SETCHARGEMODE_SLOW/IMSG_SETCHARGEMODE_FAST) 
	-Implemented option using VDD 64 ladder as comparator reference (IMSG_SETACOMPREF_DAC/IMSG_SETACOMPREF_VDD) 

	
	new and changed functions:
	
		config.c
			-GPIO_setup() - accounting for changes with HW_REVITION 6
			-charge_mode() - to allow fast charge with HW_REVITION 6 (obs, diode i testprint ble varm)
			-dust_mote_reset() - new function for mote reset. Soft reset for HW_REVITION<6, Hard reset for HW_REVITION>=6
			-dust_mote_sleep() - function to sent mote to deep sleep, requires hard reset to recover
			-battery_charge_status() - mote reset function changed to efm32_reset()
			-efm32_reset() - full system reset using NVIC_SystemReset()
		dust_com.c		
			-dust_handle_notification() - new input function for transport mode (IMSG_SETTRANSPORTMODE), reset function changed to efm32_reset()
			-dust_check_and_possibly_reset_mote() - reset function changed to efm32_reset()
						
		process.c / process.h (functions updatet to communicate with W29N01HV Nandflash)

			-flash_W29N01HV_write_page()
			-flash_W29N01HV_safe_write_page()

		rmad.c / rmad.h	(functions handeling AUX data moved)
			-main()
			
		aux_data.c / aux_data.h (moved all functions related to aux data pachages from rmad.c to this new files)
			-get_aux_and_report()
			-read_single_aux_sample()
			-read_scan_aux_sample()
			-get_new_aux_sample()
			-send_aux_data()
			-convertToCelsius()



	bugfixes:
		- fix to hopefully remove indefinite reboot cycles. The temporary implementation uses NVIC_SystemReset() to exit the loop.	
		
	know issues:
		- NANDFLASH_W29N01HV_Init() reports wrong manufacture and device code on first boot - error ignored
		- process_send_data() does not return when HW=6, quick fix with NVIC_SystemReset() reboot of EFM32 implementet to continue testing
		- AD_config(void) setting and calculation of sampligrate does not work properly, a quick fix implementet, but the issue must be looked into. SW6 for HW5 had a timestamp error due to this.
